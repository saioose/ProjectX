If Difference is negative enter BTCLONG and ETHSHORTin the avg price ratio of btc/eth, example if btc is 100k and eth is 10k while entering the trade then for 1btc 
take 10ETH , if btc is long, then short eth and if btc is short, long eth , Difference should be atleasst +0.2% or -0.2% while entering the trade.  If the difference is positive
enter BTCSHORT and ETHLONG, With the same position sizing(ratio of long short) as when the difference is negative.
If im using 10k as total capital my margin use 100$ for every trade, and use 400x leverage, which means we have 100*400= 40000$ for opening the position, now we have
to use 50% of this to long and 50% of this to short, using the above example where the difference is negative, we will enter BTCLONG(BTC price 100k) with 50% of the 
total which is 20000$, so we will long 0.2BTC and with the other 50% which is the other 20000$ we will short 2ETH. 
When the diference line crosses 0 exit the trade, this should give 0.2% profit gain in the position = 0.2% of 40000$ = 80$, so for 100$ margin on 400x leverage this 
should be = 80% and on my total capital of 10K this thould be (80/10000) *100 = 0.8%


##for backtest we have assumed that whenever the difference has crossed 0 line and reached any of the point >0.2% we have entered the trade, and when it has crossed
back to 0 we have exited the trade. Whenever we find any point with difference greater than 0.2%, we treat this as entry and whenever the difference crosses 0 after the 
0.2% entry point we treat that as exit. Whenever 1 such cycle is complete we treat that as profit 0.8% on the total capital.
